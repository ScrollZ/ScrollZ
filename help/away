Usage: AWAY [<flags>] [<away message>]
  Marks you as "away".  Whenever someone sends you a MSG or a
  does a WHOIS on you, they automatically see whatever message
  you set.  While you are away, all messages you receive will be
  timestamped and you will optionally get beeped (see SET 
  BEEP_WHEN_AWAY) for each message.  Using AWAY with no
  parameters marks you as no longer being away.

Available Flags:
  -one  Send away message to only the server in the current window.
  -all  (default) send away message to all servers you may be on.
