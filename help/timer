Usage: TIMER [-refnum <num>] [-delete <num>] <seconds> [<command>]
  Waits for the given number of seconds and then executes the
  command.  This is done without hindering normal operation of
  the client.  Any number of TIMERs can be set at once, and
  all will activate at the appropriate time.
    TIMER with arguments will list pending TIMERs.
    TIMER -refnum <num>
  will assign a specific number to that action allowing you
  to delete it later if necessary with
    TIMER -delete <num>
  If no refnum is specified, one is automatically assigned.
