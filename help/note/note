  The Note system have two main functions:
  1. Let you send one line messages to irc users which 
     they will get when they next sign on to irc.
     Example: NOTE SEND <nick> Hi, this is a note to you.
  2. Let you spy on people, to see when they sign on or off,
     change nick name or join channels.
     Example: NOTE SPY +100 <nick>  (spy on nick for 100 days)

  You may fill in none or any of the arguments listed above, including
  * or ? at any place, as nick@*.edu, !username, ni?k!username etc...
  Other usefull features may be NOTE WAIT <nick>, making nick and
  you get a message when you both are on at the same time.
 
  Note was developed 1990 by jarle@stud.cs.uit.no (Wizible on IRC).
