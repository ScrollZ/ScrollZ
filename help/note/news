Usage: NOTE NEWS [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]

  NEWS with no message is an alias for USER +RS (default max 60 days)
  This command is for subscribing on a specified newsgroup from any
  user(s) or host(s). Wildcards may be used anywhere. Example:
    NEWS irc.note       : Subscribe on irc.note
*    NEWS irc.note@*.no  : Send to group irc.note, but only for
*                          users at host *.no
*    NEWS irc.note       : Send to all for group irc.note
*    NEWS Users@*.edu Hi : Send Hi to all users using note in your
*                          server located at host *.edu.
   (Advanced users may use User +rs <...> <filter> where filter is a 
   string which must matches with field in received news message)
-  Only opers can send news as default.
*  To send news add message and use same format as subscribing, except 
*  that username field must matches with subscribed group as alt.irc!*.irc - 
*  everybody subscribing on a*.irc or *.irc or alt.irc... would get the news.
*  A speciall case is the group Users which everybody using note in the server
*  are member of.
