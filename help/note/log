Usage: NOTE LOG [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [#<ID>] <nick!username@host>
  Displays how long time since matching person was on IRC. This works 
  only after use of NOTE SPY. The log is protected to be seen for other
  users than the person who queued the SPY request. To get short
  output, do not specify any arguments. Example:
    LOG      : Print short log of all
    LOG *    : Print long log including real names of all
    LOG nick : Print long log for user nick.
