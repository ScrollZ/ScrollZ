Usage: NOTE SPY [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
		<nick!username@host> [msg]
  SPY is an alias for USER +RX (default 1 max day)
  SPY makes the server tell you if any matching recipient sign(s)
  on/off IRC or change nick name. No message needs to be specified.
  However, if a message is specified this is returned to sender including
  with the message about recipient. Message could for example be one or
  more Ctrl-G characters to activate the bell on senders machine.
  As an alternative for using C flag, <msg> field could start with
  any number of nicks on this format: %nick1 %nick2... %nickn, with
  no space between % and the nick name you use. Spy messages would be
  valid for any of the nicks specified.
  SPY with no argument would tell you what users you have spy on who are 
  currently on IRC. The system logs last time the last matching person was 
  on IRC for each SPY request is queued in the server. See NOTE LOG for this.
  You may use flag +A to see what server matching user is on, 
  and/or +J flag to see what channel. (Read HELP NOTE USER for more). Example:
    SPY foobar!username@host <ctrl-G>
    SPY +10 foobar
    SPY +aj &secret * <ctrl-G>
    SPY +365 +e !user nick!*@* <ctrl-G>
    SPY % +7 foo!user
    SPY +5 nicky %mynick %meenick
