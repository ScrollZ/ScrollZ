Usage: SET SHOW_STATUS_ALL [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When set, it shows everything in every (visible) status line.
  When not set, it only show things that (I think) are relevant
  to that window, and are not the same as the current window.
  Things like nickname, usermode, are only shown on one window,
  if connected to only one server.
