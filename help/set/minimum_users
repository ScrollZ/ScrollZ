Usage: SET MINIMUM_USERS <number of users>
  When connecting to a server, this variable is checked versus
  the number of users currently connected to the ircnet.  If
  the number of users is less than the setting of
  MINIMUM_USERS, you will automatically be disconnected from
  that server and IRCII will attempt to connect to the next
  server in you server list (as though you had some SERVER +).
  This is useful if the net is fragmented to keep you on a more
  populated portion of the net.  This will be rechecked if you
  issue a LUSERS.  This only affects your primary server.
  Secondary servers are not affected by this variable.
