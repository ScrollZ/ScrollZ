Usage: SET FLOOD_RATE <messages per second>
  FLOOD_RATE can be set to the number of messages per second you 
  wish to  activate flooding. If messages from a user outpace 
  FLOOD_RATE for  FLOOD_AFTER number of messages, ON FLOOD is
  activated.  If FLOOD_RATE is larger then FLOOD_AFTER, then you 
  will end up seeing at least FLOOD_RATE messages before flood 
  activation (If FLOOD_RATE is 5 and FLOOD_AFTER is 3 then you must 
  receive at least 5 messages before the flood rate can be 5
  messages per second).
