Usage: SET COMMAND_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  This switch was designed for those who are used to MUDs and computer
  freaks who like command oriented environments. It will disable the
  command character! Every input of yours will be expected to be a command.
  If you want to send something to your current channel or query, you'll
  have to type "send <text>" or "'<text>".
  "say <text>" will always send to the channel even if you're in a query.
  With ":<text>" you get the same effect as with "me <text>".

  The "'" and ":" abbreviations are introduced for MUD compatibility and
  are only available in COMMAND_MODE.
