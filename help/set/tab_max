Usage: SET TAB_MAX [<number of tabs>]
  This allows you to limit the maximum number of tabs you will hear
  for any given messages.  For example, if you set TAB_MAX to 3,
  and someone sends a message with more than 10 tabs in it, you
  will only see the first three tabs.  Setting TAB_MAX to 0 means
  you will see all tabs in a message.
