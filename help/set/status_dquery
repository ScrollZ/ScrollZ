Usage: SET STATUS_DQUERY <Status line text when DCC querying>
  This variable is replaced in the STATUS_FORMAT for occurrences of
  %Q when you are DCC querying someone.  This variable may contain
  any text, plus it may contain a single occurrence of %D, which
  is replaced by the name of the user you are DCC querying.  For
  example, you can set STATUS_DQUERY to "DQuerying %D", where %D
  is replaced by a the DCC query nickname.
