Usage: SET MINIMUM_SERVERS <number of servers>
  When connecting to a server, this variable is checked versus
  the number of servers currently connected to the ircnet.  If
  the number of servers is less than the setting of
  MINIMUM_SERVERS, you will automatically be disconnected from
  that server and IRCII will attempt to connect to the next
  server in you server list (as though you had done SERVER +).
  This is useful if the net is fragmented to keep you on a more
  populated portion of the net.  This will be rechecked if you
  issue a LUSERS.  This will only affect your primary server. 
  Secondary servers are not checked vs this variable.
