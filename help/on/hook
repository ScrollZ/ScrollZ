Usage: ON [#|+|-|^]HOOK [-|^]<any pattern> [action]
  This is activated whenever you receive a HOOK.  HOOKs are generated
  by the user for one purpose, which is to activate ON HOOK.
  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	$0   First word of text
	$1   Second word of text..
	$2-  Rest of pattern.   Can use whatever you like.
  Basically if you have an ON HOOK pattern   and you send a HOOK command
  that matches the pattern it will be activated.  This is useful for
  testing ON patterns, and sending commands from within scripts and 
  aliases which can be either ignored or acted upon (ON HOOK).
