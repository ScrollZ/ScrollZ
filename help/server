Usage: SERVER <name of server>|<number in server_list> [<port>]]
       SERVER <name of server>[:<port>[:<password>[:<nickname>[:<group>]]]]
       SERVER -SSL <args as above>
       SERVER [+|-]
       SERVER -DELETE <number in server_list>
  If server name starts with an exclamation mark (!) a SSL connection
  is established.
  Switches your primary server to the server specified at the
  specified port number.   If no port number is given, the default
  port number is used.   Your channel and AWAY status will remain
  unchanged.   Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the
  irc   network can send out the information that you have left a
  server.  So don't be surprised if it says your nickname is in 
  use...  just wait a moment and set it with NICK.  ScrollZ
  maintains an internal list of servers you have connected to.
  To see that list, use SERVER with no arguments.  You may also
  specify one of the servers in the server list by its number in
  the list, by issuing:
    SERVER <number in list>
  Likewise, you can automatically switch to the next or previous
  server in the server list by doing:
    SERVER + 
  or 
    SERVER - 
  to switch to the next and previous server in the list,
  respectively.  The second form allows you to specify a port,
  a password and a nickname to be used for this IRC connection.
  Also, you can set a particular server to be associated with a
  particular ScrollZ window.  To do this, set the current window to the
  window you wish to use and do:
    SERVER +servername
  In this case, servername may again be a name, IP address, or number
  of a server in your server list.
  This will connect you to the given server as a secondary server in
  that window.  Doing a /SERVER with no parameters will show you your
  primary server.  If you kill the last window associated with a
  server, the connection to that server will close.  If you kill the
  last window associated with your primary server, a new open server
  will be chosen as the primary server.  If there are open servers you
  will not be allowed to close the connection to your primary server.
  When you create new windows, they will use as their associated
  server whatever was the server for the current window when the new
  window was created.  You can therefore have more than one window for
  any server, but still only one primary server.

  Every time you switch to a new server, it gets
  added to the server list automatically.  To set up initial
  servers in the server list, you can specify them on the command
  line as such:
    irc <nickname> server1 server2 server3
  Each host may have its own port number, password, nickname and
  group specified on the command line, as well:
    irc <nickname> server1:6667 server2:7000:blah server3::foo::testnet
  In this case, server1 will use port 6667, server2 will use port
  7000 with password blah, and server3 will use the default port
  number, with password foo, and be put into group testnet.  The
  -p switch on the command line allows you to specify the default
  port number.  Also, if no password is specified and one is needed
  to connect, you will be prompted to enter a password before you can
  connect.  You can also specify the default server list in the
  IRCSERVER environment variable using the same format as above.

Available flags:
  -SSL <normal arguments>
    Make this a SSL connection.
  -DELETE <number in servers list>
    Allows you to remove servers from the internal server list.
