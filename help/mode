Usage: MODE *|<channel> [+|-]<modechars> [<parameters>]
       MODE *|<channel> [+|-]b [<nick>[!<user>[@<host>]]]
       MODE <nick> [+|-]<umodechars>

  Mode command is quite complicated and it allows channel
  operators to change channel mode, or any user to change
  their personal mode. For a channel mode, <modechars> is one of 
  the following:
    i                - channel is invite only
    k <key>          - Adds join key <key> to the channel.  Keys can added or
		       removed (MODE <channel> -k <key>), but not changed.
    l <number>       - channel is limited, where <number> is the
                       maximum number of users allowed
    m                - channel is moderated (only channel operators talk)
    n                - No MSGs to the channel are allowed
		       from someone outside the channel.
    o <nick>         - Makes <nick> a channel operator
    p                - channel is private
    s                - channel is secret
                       Note: On 2.8 servers you cannot set both +p and +s modes
    t                - topic limits, only the channel operators may change it
    v <nick>         - Gives someone a voice to talk on a moderated channel. 
    b user!nick@host - Adds ban
    e user!nick@host - Adds ban exception
    I user!nick@host - Adds need-invite exception (notice uppercase I)

  A + or - sign determines whether the specified mode should be
  added or deleted.
  If you supply * as channel name, modes will apply to your current channel.

  The form which takes user!nick@host is special in that
  it needs specifying a sting of the form nick!user@host.
  Banning examples:
    MODE #MyChannel +b *!*@gus.*
  bans everybody from the channel who is on IRC from any
  machine whose name is gus.
    MODE #MyChannel +b netw1z
  bans anybody using the nickname netw1z.
    MODE #MyChannel +b *!merklin@*
  bans anybody whose user name is merklin.
    MODE #MyChannel +b jerk!tug@boat.edu
  bans the user tug@boat.edu from the channel whenever he
  is using the nickname "jerk".

  You can list the bans in effect on a channel:
    MODE #MyChannel b
  With the same way, you can list invite-exceptions on a channel:
    MODE #MyChannel I
  And ban exceptions:
    MODE #MyChannel e
  
  The third form of the MODE command allows you to modify your
  personal parameters. You can precede any combination of the
  following with + or - (+to switch that mode on, - to switch it off).

    o        - IRC operator status. You may not turn this on
               with mode. To assert operator status, you must use OPER
    w        - Receive WALLOPS (messages directed at all operators.
               see WALLOPS.
    s        - Receive server notices. This includes KILL notices
               and notices about what is happening with links
               to the local server.
    i        - Render yourself invisible. This prevents you from
               being seen in WHO and WHOIS information, unless
               somebody specifies your exact nickname with WHOIS.
               This is quite useful, because it often let's you
               "idle in peace" without getting harmed by mass
               advertisers etc.

Note:
  Attempting to avoid a ban placed on you may result in
  forcible removal from IRC or being banned from your server.
