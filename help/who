Usage: WHO [-switch [<arg>]] [<wildcard expression>]
  Gives a listing of the users on irc.  If no flags are
  specified, the wildcard expression you supply will 
  match any field returned by WHO.  However, if the wildcard
  expression is "*" (an asterisk), the users on the current
  channel are shown.  Note that WHO * will fail if you 
  are not on a channel.  If the expression is 0, all users on 
  irc are shown.  The following switches are also recognized 
  and used to limit the listing:
    -OPERATORS            - lists only operators
    -LUSERS		  - lists only non operators
    -CHOPS		  - lists only channel operators
    -NAME <username>      - lists only people with matching 
                            user-ids
    -FILE <filename>      - lists only people listed in the
			    file
    -HOST		  - Lists users from the specified host.
    -SERVER		  - Lists users from the specified server.
    -HERE		  - Lists only those marked as here.
    -AWAY		  - Lists only those marked away.
    -NICK 		  - Match only the given nickname

  The switches may be abbreviated unambiguously.  All matching of
  usernames, hostnames, and servernames may contain wildcards (*).
  Wildcards in the form "*.edu" are also correctly recognized
  by the IRC server (so there's no need for ScrollZ to do that).
