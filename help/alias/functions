ScrollZ Functions
  ScrollZ functions are substituted with the format $FUNCTION(arguments).
  A function is an ALIAS which assigns a value to FUNCTION_RETURN.
  For example:
    ALIAS DOUBLE assign FUNCTION_RETURN ${[$0]+[$0]}
  which is the same as:
    ALIAS DOUBLE @ function_return = [$0] * 2
  used with:
    ALIAS SHOWDOUBLE echo $DOUBLE($0)
  will cause
    SHOWDOUBLE 7
  to display "14".

  The following built-in functions already exist and cannot be overriden:
  (n!u@h stands for nick!user@host)

  CDCCSLOTS()           Returns the number of free Cdcc slots
  CDCCQSLOTS()          Returns the number of free Cdcc queue slots
  CHATPEERS()           Returns the list of nicks who you have dcc-chat
                        connections with, in format nick,nick2,...
                        Useful if you want to broadcast.
  CHANUSERS(channel X)  Returns a list of users on channel.
                        If X is 1 every nick returned will have a status
                        character prepended to it:
                        @ - chanop
                        + - voiced
                        % - halfopped
                        . - other
  CHECKUSER(n!u@h channel) Returns user flags, filter and channels
                        for userlist entry matching n!u@h and channel
                        or -1 on error
  CHECKSHIT(n!u@h channel) Returns user flags, filter and channels
                        for shitlist entry matching n!u@h and channel
                        or -1 on error
  CHR(LIST)             Returns string from a list of ascii codes
  CLOSE(HANDLE)         Closes the file denoted by HANDLE.
  COLOR(STRING)         STRING can be two numbers in which case the first
                        number is the event and the second number is in
                        range from 1 to 6. In this case the color number
                        matching second number is returned from the colors
                        defined for the event matching first number. See
                        also COLOR.
                        Additionally you can specify color mnemonics:
                        normal, bold, underline, flash, reverse, black,
                        red, green, yellow, blue, purple, cyan, white,
                        blackbg, redbg, greenbg, yellowbg, bluebg,
                        purplebg, cyanbg, whitebg or nobold (this one
                        turns all bold off).
  CONNECT(HOST PORT)    Returns the file descriptor for the connection.
                        A NULL fd means host could not be resolved.
                        Negative fd means some error occurred in the attempt.
                        Communication through the connection is done with 
                        DCC RAW and ON DCC_RAW.
                        (See DCC RAW and ON DCC_RAW)

                        to where the cursor is now.
  CRYPT(salt key)       Crypts the input using the BSD crypt() function.
                        There is no way of decrypting the result. This
                        could be used for password crypting in a bot.
                        (Note that this function is available
                        only if the system libraries contain it.)
  DCCLIST(nick)         Returns a list of dcc operations for specified nick.
                        The list is a string which consists of two-character
                        constants, where first char is one of:
                              (C)hat, (S)end, (G)et, (T)alk, s(U)mmon,
                              raw_(L)isten and (R)aw.
                        Second char is one of:
                              (C)losed, (A)ctive, (W)aiting, (O)ffered.
                        You can use this for example to detect if
                        you have a dcc-chat connection to someone.
                        Returns 0 if you don't specify nick.
  DECODE(encoded text)  Decode a single STRING of text produced by ENCODE()
                        into it's original characters.  Note that these are
                        case sensitive.
  EOF(HANDLE)           Returns non-zero if end-of-file indicator is set
                        for file denoted by HANDLE.
  ENCODE(input text)    Convert input text to an encoded string suitable for
                        use as an ScrollZ variable or alias name.  Any special

                        filename to denote your home dir.
  HASVOICE(nick channel) Returns 1 if nick has voice on the given channel.
                        Note that if the person is an operator on the given
                        channel, this function is unreliable: It returns 1.
