Usage: ENCRYPT [-<type>] [<nickname>|<channel> [<key>]]
       ENCRYPT [-showkeys]
  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with 
  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
  key is specified, all messages you send to that 
  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
  will automatically be decrypted. ircII is smart enough to know
  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to 
  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].

  The <key> can be any text which is to be used an they key 
  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon 
  a key and how to communicate it to one another.

  If <type> is specified, ircII will use this cryptography
  method rather than the default.  The current options are
  -sed and -cast.  If cast support is enabled, it is the
  default.

  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a 
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.  

  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.

  If ENCRYPT is given with no arguments, the list of encrypted
  users and encryption types are displayed.  If the -showkeys
  option is specified, the keys for each user are also displayed.

  older ircII used a built in encryption method that isn't terribly
  secure.  After ircII 4.4, CAST-128 support was added and is now
  the default.  You can use another if you so choose, see
  ENCRYPT_PROGRAM for information about this.  Note that in
  releases prior to 4.4B, ircII used a different type of program
  API for ENCRYPT_PROGRAM.
 
  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
  appear in the input line.  

Note:
  Control-q is bound (see BIND) to quote_character by default.
  It is frequently necessary to change this to some other char.
