Usage: KILL <nickname> <comment>
  Removes a person from irc.  This is an operator command
  and should be used with extreme caution (if at all). The
  comment is necessary to let others the reason for the kill.
  If you don't give a comment, you will probably be bombarded
  with messages saying "why the kill?"

  Regarding so called 'ghosts'.  These are generated typically when
  someone accidently does a shell escape out of irc, (see BIND STOP_IRC)
  and they start a new process.  They think the old one is a 'ghost'.
  The way to get rid of these ghosts is to QUIT the current session
  and type 'ps -gx' or 'ps -f' at the unix command prompt.
  This will generate a listing looking something like.
    unix> ps -gx
      PID TT STAT   TIME COMMAND
    15472 p8 S      1:20 irc Daemon
  Where all the user has to do now is type 
    unix> kill -9 15472
  and the problem is fixed.  This is preferable to the IRC KILL command
  which is not 100% effective. kill -9 is.

  If you cannot manage to get the above to work, try typing at the unix
  command prompt:
    kill -9 -1
  This will often kill all your processes, then you only have to log in again.

  With the advent of auto-reconnecting clients KILL is almost
  totally worthless as a tool for punishment.   More effective
  methods to deal with obnoxious people are the IGNORE, KICK
  and various MODE's on channels, such as +i and +b.
