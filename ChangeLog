4.4J
Thu Jul 15 12:18:44 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	help/load/icb, script/icb:
		add `/register'
	include/config.h*, include/server.h, include/icb.h,
	source/irc.c, source/server.c, doc/ircII.1:
		add -P switch to set deafult ICB port.  have a
		define `ICB_PORT' (that is 7326) for the default.
	source/cast.c, source/dcc.c, include/irc_std.h,
	include/cast_sbox.h:
		replace 'cast_t' with 'castkey' and 'u_32int_t'
		with 'u_32int' as _t is not my name space.
	source/cast.c:
		fix several bugs noted by Michael Katzenmayer
		<katzenmayer@erfnet.com>:  castkey had u_char instead
		of u_int, and some packaging problems introduced since
		the CBC changes.

Thu Jun 17 16:38:34 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/alias.c, help/alias/functions:
		new $SERVERTYPE() function that returns either
		`IRC2.X' (X between 5 and 11 so far), or `ICB'.
		idea from tristan@ethereal.net.

4.4I
Sat May 22 00:00:11 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	include/crypt.h:
		rename CAST128ED to CAST128ED-CBC so that newer
		implementations will fail to operate with prior
		versions, rather than attempt to work and lose.

Fri May 21 18:29:15 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	configure, configure.in, acconfig.h, include/defs.h.in,
	source/crypt.c:
		use /dev/urandom if possible.  avoid using the
		implementation namespace a bit...
	source/wserv.c:
		fix this for unix domain 4.4BSD machines.
	source/term.c:
		ensure we catch all ESC aliases...
	source/parse.c:
		let older /on join's work again.
	source/icb.c:
		make sure we properly disconnect a server.  for
		public and private messages, be sure not to overflow
		the 255 byte ICB limit.
	source/exec.c:
		for /exec's that have output elsewhere, make sure
		that they go to the right server.
	source/cast.c:
		change CAST-128 implmentation from EBC mode to CBC
		mode.  this is incompatible with previous versions
		but as EBC is less secure, too bad.

Mon Mar  8 14:13:54 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	configure, configure.in, acconfig.h, include/defs.h.in,
	source/cast.c, source/crypt.c:
		look for and, if we find it, use /dev/random as
		a source of randomness for crypto code.
	source/icb.c, source/edit.c, include/icb.h:
		add a new icb_put_funny_stuff() that handles doing
		irc-like /names and /list.
	script/global:
		load tabkey & icb by default.

Fri Mar  5 15:24:11 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	include/server.h, script/icb, source/edit.c, source/icb.c,
	source/irc.c, source/parse.c, source/server.c,
	source/whois.c source/window.c:
		add an extra argument to the parse_server_info()
		stuff, that returns anything beyond the nick.
		this is used by the ICB code to set default group
		and mode.  you can specify that a server is ICB
		in the IRCSERVER and related lists by prepending
		it with IRC/.  eg set IRCSERVER to:
		`ICB/icb.network.net:7326::mynick:channel'.

4.4H
Thu Mar  4 19:42:31 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	include/server.h, source/numbers.c, source/server.c,
	source/window.c:
		connect_to_server() and find_in_server_list() both
		take a "nick" argument now.  server lists are unique
		now only if the nickname is the same.
	source/icb.c:
		parse status messages for signon/signoff/arrive/depart
		and convert them to join/leave hooks.
	source/screen.c:
		deal with no current_screen.  helps with output
		functions run during client startup not dumping core.
		update fwrite() tests to be consistent.

Thu Mar  4 18:54:08 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	include/hook.h, include/hook.h.proto, source/edit.c,
	source/hook.c, source/icb.c, source/irc.c, source/server.c:
		add hooks for ICB stuff.  implement two new hooks
		for ICB only stuff: ICB_STATUS and ICB_ERROR, for
		icb status and error messages.  all others go via
		server_notice, msg, public, send_msg, send_public
		which exist.  more to come.

Thu Mar  4 17:56:26 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/irc.c, source/icb.c, source/server.c, 
	include/server.h:
		fix -irc/-icb args to skip the rc/cb bit.  add
		a icb group concept, separate to the irc channels.

Thu Mar  4 14:24:25 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	include/irc.h, include/server.h, source/irc.c,
	source/server.c, source/window.c:
		if run as "icb", default to icb.  add -irc/-icb
		switch to the command line, and -irc to both
		/window server and /server.

Thu Mar  4 13:10:41 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/ctcp.c:
		dcc actions to the right window. from forcer.
	configure, configure.in:
		cast recv() address argument to (struct sockaddr *)
		to let it compile, and let the nonblock test have a
		chance at working.  from forcer.
	source/numbers.c:
		print a channel not available message even if we
		don't understand it properly, so that the user gets
		the message anyway.
	contrib/README, (removed contrib/colour and contrib/colour.orig),
	include/config.h*, include/irc.h include/vars.h.proto,
	include/vars.h, source/screen.c, source/vars.c:
		add a /set colour to mimic mIRC-style colours.  it
		does not use termcap colour stuff, as no one uses
		those anyway.  at least on IRC.  this is sarayans
		original patch as maintained by forcer, and what
		was originally in the contrib directory.
	source/dcc.c:
		print ip:port for dcc send.  from forcer.

Wed Mar  3 18:06:17 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/newio.c, include/newio.h:
		add a "dgets_separator" that lets you change the
		"end of line" charater. this is useful for ICB
		where it is a nul, not a newline.
	help/icb, include/icb.h, include/server.h, script/icb,
	source/Makefile.in, source/edit.c, source/icb.c, source/irc.c,
	source/notify.c, source/server.c, source/window.c:
		add elementary ICB support.  /server -icb host port
		should do the right thing, and let you join channels,
		see messages, send then.  a new /icb command lets you
		have access to all the icb commands, and most IRC
		commands that make sense in this context (/nick,
		/topic, /version, /msg, /join, etc) have been modified
		to know the are talking to an ICB server and pass the
		users request off to the icb code to handle.  this
		uses the new dgets_separator() for ICB server
		connection processing.
		this is missing hooks and stuff, but it should be at
		least usable for now.  i expect to add hooks and stuff
		shortly.  the script adds aliases for icb commands
		(/group, /boot, /pass, etc.), and the help file is
		fairly useless...

4.4G
Sun Feb 28 13:37:48 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/screen.c:
		use ssize_t for the length, and cast it to size_t
		where needed, to avoid it overflowing.
	various:
		use __SVR4 as the canonical SVR4 preprocessor
		define, as it is.
	source/hook.c, include/hook.h.proto, include/hook.h, help/on/join:
		/on join takes 3 args.
	configure.in, acconfig.h, source/dcc.c:
		add writev & <sys/uio.h> check and use it if possible.
	doc/ircII.1:
		document the -b flag.
	source/server.c:
		call the right parse_server() routine in all cases.
	source/ctcp.c:
		be saner about PARANOID.
	source/dcc.c, source/ctcp.c, source/crypt.c, source/cast.c,
	source/edit.c, include/crypt.h:
		convert to a "crypt_key" type for crypto keys, rather
		than passing around char *'s.  this lets the key be
		opaque and let the crypto engine hide in here.
	source/ctcp.c, source/crypt.c, source/cast.c source/sed.c, 
	include/crypt.h, include/ctcp.h, help/encrypt:
		split SED code into sed.c.  allow more than one type
		of crypto system to be compiled in.  currently there
		is only support for SED and CAST-128.

4.4F
Tue Feb  9 21:30:37 EST 1999 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/crypt.c, source/ctcp.c, source/dcc.c:
		various bug fixes to crypto code.

Tue Feb 02 03:45:58 est 1999 - glen mccready <glen@qnx.com> 
	source/exec.c, help/exec:
		add /exec -target.
		
Sun Jan 03 20:19:54 est 1999 - glen mccready <glen@qnx.com>
	source/alias.c:
		more functions, winsrvr() and winsrvrgrp() to return
		the windows server and server_group.
	source/window.c:
		make "window query" work like "query".

Sun Jan 03 17:21:02 est 1999 - glen mccready <glen@qnx.com>
	source/alias.c:
		add a couple of useful functions.  one, winvis(), to
		tell you if a window is visible.  another, querynick(),
		to tell you what nick, if any, a window is queried to.

Sun Jan 03 12:42:44 est 1999 - glen mccready <glen@qnx.com>
	source/window.c:
		allow "window channel #chan,key" to work.

4.4E
Sun Nov  8 16:23:19 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/cast.c:
		be defensive about putting the final nul back in
		to the string: it can never be >7 as the blocksize
		is 8...
	source/ctcp.c:
		quote ':' with a standard quote character in
		ctcp_quote_it() as do_ctcp() treats : specially (if
		it is the first char of a string).  the avoids
		accidentally losing the first character of a string.

Fri Nov  6 19:33:31 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	acconfig.h, configure, configure.in, include/alias.h,

	source/stack.c, source/status.c, source/term.c, source/translat.c,
	source/vars.c, source/whois.c, source/window.c, source/wserv.c:
		make (almost) compile with quite anal gcc flags under
		NetBSD 1.3H, quietly.  this adds support for finding
		a locally delcared "errno", and also removes a bunch of
		the old STDC crap with passing char's to functions.
		also fixed a few bugs that were found!

4.4D
Fri Nov  6 02:38:34 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/dcc.c:
		add untested code for using writev if available.
		also, fix dcc chat encryption.
	source/irc.c, source/notice.c, source/parse.c, source/whois.c:
		clean up "int sed;" processing.

Wed Oct 28 12:11:10 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/dcc.c, source/flood.c, source/irc.c, source/ircaux.c,
	source/numbers.c, source/parse.c, source/server.c,
	source/window.c, include/irc.h:
		remove NICKNAME_LEN. make nicks dynamically allocated.
		this is so ircII works on blundernet.
	source/dcc.c:
		fix some problems with encrypted dcc chat.  still not
		totally working...

4.4C
Sun Sep 27 12:18:08 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/screen.c:
		fix flash-style attacks, by checking for characters
		0-32 with the high-bit set (128->160) and performing
		the same alternation on those.
	contrib/README, contrib/colour, contrib/colour.orig:
		add the new colour patch from PR#332, moving the old
		one to colour.orig.  from forcer.
	source/alias.c:
		use the current server for $A and $N expansion, not
		the current window.  from flier@globecom.netin pr 300.

Sun Sep 27 02:28:08 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	translation/POLISH, translation/POLISH_NOPL:
		fixed polish translation tables, from Piotr Kucharski
		<chopin@sgh.waw.pl> in pr#344.
	source/edit.c, include/edit.h:
		make /timer server-away.  from flier in pr#295.

Sat Sep 26 12:36:02 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/alias.c:
		fix $rindex(), using patch in pr335 from Tristan Horn
		<tristan@ethereal.net>.
	source/numbers.c:
		if we get end of motd, and we haven't seen a 002 or
		version notice, fake one up...

Sat Sep 26 03:58:30 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/server.c, source/window.c, source/numbers.c,
	source/help.c, source/dcc.c:
		change {save,restore}_message_from() into a queue so
		that now that we use them for every message_from(),
		info is not by too save_ callers before a restore_.
		fix some of the callers of these functions to work
		properly in the presence of a queue.

Wed Sep 23 00:51:22 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/notice.c:
		allow server notices to see the 1st parameter as it
		comes from the server, as it may be a channel.  from
		galibert@iria.mines.u-nancy.fr (Olivier Galibert) in
		pr#239.
	script/2.9script:
		deal with PR#217 sanely now we have the above.
	configure, configure.in:
		check for gcc on QNX (from glen).
	source/numbers.c:
		deal with number 405. fixes pr#336.
	source/alias.c:
		fix overflow in eval echo [3232235777/255].
	configure, configure.in: source/exec.c:
		don't go past the end of the signals array.
	source/log.c:
		fix core dump through nulref from flier in pr#334.

Tue Sep 22 20:38:16 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/names.c, source/notice.c, source/notify.c, source/numbers.c,
	source/parse.c, source/server.c, source/whois.c, source/window.c:
		rework message_from() usage:  now we use the two handy
		functions {save,restore}_message_from() a lot throughout
		the tree (when using message_from()).  this ensures that
		the from level/message level/from who/etc are all set
		correctly at all times.  also fix a few bugs here.
		/notify, /help, ctcp messages and several other systems
		were not properly restoring or setting the levels.  this,
		i believe, is the cause of random messages going to the
		wrong place, extremely rarely.  i belive i have fixed
		all of these problems now, and perhaps not broken anything.
		also fix temporary setting of from_server that did not
		restore the previous value.
	source/alias.c:
		avoid using from_server or parsing_server_index as an index
		if it is < 0.

Wed Sep 16 11:04:45 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

Tue Sep  8 00:43:18 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	INSTALL, Makefile.in, easyinst:
		remove easyinst, document --with[out]-cast.

Mon Sep  7 18:33:01 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/irc.v, doc/VERSIONS:
		bump version to 4.4B, due to the CAST-128 support.
	configure, configure.in:
		change --with-cast to support `=no', and also if we
		find source/cast.c, enable cast support.  fix alignment
		of some strings for --with-cast and --with-paranoid.

Mon Sep  7 15:11:57 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/cast.c, source/crypt.c, source/ctcp.c, include/crypt.h,
	include/cast_sbox.h, acconfig, configure configure.in:
		add a --with-cast switch to configure, to enable built-in
		CAST-128 encryption support, rather than the old broken
		crypt.  requires cast.c and cast_sbox.h that will *not*
		be distributed with ircII by default.

Sat Sep  5 21:39:36 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/crypt.c, help/encrypt, help/set/old_encrypt_program,
	help/set/encrypt_program:
		change encrypt_program to write key as first line,
		rather than insecure cmd line argument.  add a new
		`old_encrypt_program' (default off) variable to use
		the old API.  XXX the exec code here has lots of
		syscalls with no return values checked XXX.

Tue Jun  2 18:48:39 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/queue.c:
		fix core dumps.  pr#298.
	doc/ircII.1:
		document the "global" script.  pr#315.

Tue Jun  2 18:13:09 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	help/window/bind, help/window/unbind:
		new help files.
	script/nocolour:
		stop mIRC colour crap.
	source/server.c:
		match server name correctly.  noted in pr#301.
	source/dcc.c:
		print ip/port in dcc requests.  per pr#325.
	source/crypt.c:
		call setgid() before setuid().  call wait() after exec().
		there are still MANY system calls with unchecked return
		values here but at least it seems to work now.  at least
		with `/usr/games/caeser' as the encryption program, and 13
		as the key (rot13 :).
	configure.in, configure:
		AMS mail is ~/Mailbox as a directory, not a file.  this
		fixes problems with qmail installations.

Tue Jun  2 16:11:05 EST 1998 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/names.c:
		initialise new->status, which fixes the "channel leave"
		bug, noted in several PR's (fix from 328).
	source/mail.c:
		use my_strnicmp().  from mark.
	configure, configure.in, acconfig.h, include/defs.h.in, source/ctcp.c:
		add a --with-paranoid switch which disables the "bad" parts of
		ctcp version/finger replies.
	source/ctcp.c, source/dcc.c, source/edit.c:
		allow dcc channels to have (only) ctcp queries.  involved some
		interface changes to send_ctcp() and related functions.  for now,
		no replies are generated -- there is no privmsg/notice in a dcc
		chat connection.
	source/ctcp.c:
		ensure ctcp functions that return data return it in a malloced
		string, and ensure that the caller cleans this up.  should fix
		several problems noted over the last several years.
	source/dcc.c, include/irc.h:
		avoid buffer overflows in dcc chat connections.  noted by forcer.

Fri Jan 12 02:20:00 EST 1997 - glen mccready <glen@qnx.com>

		notify_mark is prototyped where it's used.  fudge some
		qnx defaults further in configure.
	source/queue.c:
		fix segv (pr#292).
	source/vars.c:
		fix "/set logfile ~/blah".
	source/ircaux.c, source/alias.c, include/ircaux.h:

		fix PR280:  don't set SERVERREQ for /msg as it breaks
		dcc chat and /disconnect-ed.

Tue Nov 25 16:52:31 EST 1997 - matthew green <mrg@eterna.com.au>
	source/edit.c:
		hack:  fix pr272:  set lastlog/loglevel to CRAP for
		xecho -window.
	source/numbers.c:
		fix pr273:  numerics 471, 473, 474, 475 and 476 need
		to be caught my the client before hooking.  do so.
	source/notice.c:
		fix pr274 (i think, i can not test this):  if the server
		doesn't give a 'normal' 002 numeric, don't totally lose.
		pretend it's a 2.9 server and go from there.
	source/ctcp.c, source/edit.c:
		from flier in pr275:  don't free the return value of
		crypt_msg().
	source/lastlog.c:
		fix pr276:  free the malloced copy, and use strncmp().

	source/edit.c:
		giver user indication of SQUERY (idea from kalt).

		the wserv process doesn't get started, and the client will
		hang in the accept().  Removed the force arguement from
		kill_screen(), and all the calls to it.

	source/edit.c:
		renamed new_send_line() to sendlinecmd() so that it follows
		the general ircII pattern (is there such a thing ? - phone :)
		
Tue Jan 26 19:03:51 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/status.c
		Added poxaV's patch to put time in standard format.

Mon Jan 25 09:14:10 EST 1993 - Brian Koehmstedt <bpk@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	source/crypt.c, source/dcc.c, source/exec.c, source/help.c,
	source/irc.c, source/ircaux.c, source/notice.c, source/scandir.c,
	source/term.c, source/ircflush.c:
		added support for Linux

Mon Jan 25 02:52:14 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/dcc.c, source/exec.c, source/server.c, source/window.c:
		added close_all_dcc(), close_all_exec() and close_all_server(),
		which are called from create_additional_screen(), from the
		forked process to close all unneeded file descriptors.
		create_screen() - fixed bug when create_screen() returns a
		screen that was marked as being !alive.
		Hmm, somewhere here I think I have fixed the bug with the
		position of the cursor, when using more than one screen.
		No idea if it is fixed, but I can't get it to happen.
	source/names.c:
		set_window_channel() - fixed bug when channel was NULL.

Mon Jan 25 11:44:20 EST 1993 - Charles Hannum <mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	source/window.c:
		scroll_window() - fixed bug that deleted text from the
		input prompt

Thu Jan 21 18:16:16 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/window.c, source/dcc.c:
		Added flag to dcc_message_transmit(), to indicate if the
		hook/put_it() call should be made.  Used when redirecting
		to a dcc chat connection, which is now possible.

Wed Jan 20 23:41:50 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/window.c, source/edit.c, source/whois.c, source/window.h:
		Changed how REDIRECT works.  We now send a redirect token
		to the server when redirecting, not a wait token.  It is in
		the form of #RED#nnnn where nnnn is the screen's number
		(internal).  Redirect also is a property of the screen, not
		of the whole of ircII.  This means that there are no more
		valid reasons to call irc_io() recursively.
	source/mysetjmp.h, source/mysetjmp.c, source/irc.c, source/alias.c,
	source/window.c, source/window.h:
		Removed all the code that was applicable to the mysetjmp()
		code, as there are no need for it anymore - only /WAIT and
		$".." call irc_io() recursively, and they can be used in
		other (better) ways.

Tue Jan 19 14:05:52 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/help.c:
		You guessed it.. another bug.. fixed.
	source/window.c;
		window() - fixed bugs in WINDOW SERVER.
	source/parse.c, source/edit.c, source/exec.c:
		Added doing_privmsg, which makes ircII convert all attempts
		to PRIVMSG from a PRIVMSG in to a NOTICE.
	source/parse.c, source/whois.c:
		Added flag to HOST and USERHOST commands.  It allows a command
		to be executed when the the userhost (302) reply comes back
		from the server - userhost_cmd_returned().
	source/edit.c;
		Added new command INPUT.  Takes a ".." prompt as its first
		parameter, and displays this, and prompts for input that
		expanded, and passed to the command that is its second arg.
		(ie, /INPUT "prompt> " echo $*).  This should be used as
		a replacement for $".." type variables.

Sun Jan 17 22:01:34 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/help.c:
		help_prompt() - fixed another bug..  when will it end..?
	source/dcc.c:
		register_dcc_offer() - made dcc collisions for DCC CHAT
		automatically connect to the other party.  Impressed.
	source/window.h, source/window.c:
		Added new define in winodw.h SCROLL_AFTER_DISPLAY .. which
		makes the display scroll like it used to in 2.1.5.

Sun Jan 17 01:16:37 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/funny.c:
		Fixed lame bug in funny_list() which caused the wide list
		to be corrupted when more than 50 in it.

Sat Jan 16 17:42:41 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/window.c:
		Fixed stupid bug in window(), in the CHANNEL command.
	source/dcc.c:
		Forgot dcc get for lame ultrix - fixed.
	source/lastlog.c:
		lastlog() - made it possible to /lastlog <pattern> <count>
		now.
	source/help.c:
		help_me() - fixed a stupid bug that would cause help to
		become trapped, and unusable for that session.

Fri Jan 15 16:26:13 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/irc.c, source/window.c:
		Finally got irc_io() knowing when a socket connection to
		a wserv process closes, and to kill that screen, I know
		don't know of any pending bugs directly related to
		WINDOW CREATE.

	source/irc.c, source/help.c:
		Got help working properly again (I think), and all the
		checking to make sure ircII won't get confused, etc.

Fri Jan 15 03:07:48 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/help.c:
		Added variable help_screen, that is set when we enter a
		help command, and is set to NULL when we exit.  In help(),
		I made it illegal to call help from more then one screen
		at the same time.
	source/irc.c, source/window.c:
		Added new function is_main_screen(), and added code to 
		irc_io() to detect if a screen is closed from something
		other than window delete.

Thu Jan 14 12:37:10 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	Makefile, source/Makefile.proto:
		Removed the INSTALL section of this, replacing it with a
		cp, strip, and chmod, as not all machines support install.
		Also added new target `everything' to the Makefile.. that
		does the same as `make all ircflush ircserv wserv'.

Wed Jan 13 18:19:26 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/alias.c, source/edit.c:
		Smallish revamp of the whole modules, formatting for 80 columns
		and smallish optimizations here and there.  Could be bugs here
		I guess.
	source/crypt.c, source/ctcp.c, source/dcc.c, source/exec.c,
	source/flood.c, source/funny.c, source/help.c, source/history.c,
	source/hold.c, source/hook.c, source/if.c, source/ignore.c,
	source/input.c, source/irc.c, source/ircaux.c, source/ircflush.c,
	source/ircserv.c, source/key.c, source/lastlog.c, source/list.c,
	source/log.c, source/mail.c, source/menu.c, source/mysetjmp.c
	source/names.c, source/newio.c, source/notice.c, source/notify.c
	source/numbers.c, source/output.c, source/parse.c source/reg.c,
	source/status.c, source/server.c, source/term.c source/translat.c,
	source/vars.c, source/whois.c, source/window.c, source/wserv.c:
		reformatted for 80 columns, hopefully thats the end of the
		formatting saga..  :)

Tue Jan 12 16:42:55 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/dcc.c:
		Changed the call to put_it() for ultrix machines so that
		the floating pointers won't get garbled.
	source/ctcp.c, source/ctcp.h:
		Fixed send_ctcp_reply(), and removed Transmit_CTCP() moving
		the 2 lines to the only place it was called from.
	source/translat.c, source/term.c, source/ignore.c:
		reformatted.

Mon Jan 11 16:40:14 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/window.c:
		Changed window() so that the handling of HOLD_MODE called
		set_int_var() rather than reset_line_cnt().  Fixed a problem
		with /flush.

Mon Jan 11 01:35:22 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/lastlog.c, source/file.c, source/crypt.c, source/list.c:
		reformatted.

Mon Jan 11 00:29:41 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/names.h, source/names.c, source/window.c, source/window.h,
	source/edit.c, source/parse.c:
		Changed the handing of WINDOW CHANNEL, and JOIN so that
		ircII now remembers what window a channel was joined on.
		channel() in both parse.c and edit.c were changed, 
		add_channel() in names.c.  New function, set_channel_window()
		added, in names.c thats sets a channel's window, and as such,
		Window * added to ChannelList.  This sometimes helps ircII
		remember what channels were on which windows, when
		re-connecting to a server.  Sometimes.

	source/ctcp.c, source/output.c, source/hook.h.proto, source/parse.c,
	source/output.h:
		Moved the ctcp_* functions in output.c to ctcp.c, where they
		belong, and also put in_on_who in hook.h.proto, and fixed
		those fucntions that used it.

Sun Jan 10 10:30:20 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/funny.c:
		Changed funny_list(), fixing the -TOPIC argument to the
		LIST command.  Changed the functionality of -TOPIC so
		that it works *with* the other arguements, not against
		them.

Sun Jan 10 09:23:43 EST 1993 - poxaV <cgw@unt.edu>

	source/vars.h.proto, source/vars.c, source/status.c, config.h:
		renamed status_user() to status_user0(), and added 3
		new functions, status_user[123]()..  New variables
		STATUS_USER[0-3] ..  to go with the new status line
		functions, %X, %Y and %Z.

Thu Jan  7 00:13:14 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/status.c:
		Fixed status_oper() so that it wouldn't show
		if SHOW_STATUS_ALL wasn't set.

Wed Jan  6 19:04:42 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/funny.c:
		Changed funny_print_widelist() ..  it now works
		again, I don't know when I broke it.

Wed Jan  6 11:59:11 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/term.c, source/wserv.c:
		Made the term_init() call used in wserv to set the
		line discipline to RAW, so I could forget about
		having to worry about signals, and removed the
		SIGINT handling from wserv.c.  Hopefully this means
		that wserv works properly now.  (thanks to Dizzy
		<nathan@eas.gatech.edu> for help with this).

Wed Jan  6 00:03:00 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/Makefile.proto:
		updated depandancies, and re-organised the
		SOURCES and OBJECTS.

	source/timer.c, source/edit.c, source/irc.c, source/irc.h,
	source/mysetjmp.c, source/mysetjmp.h, source/window.c:
		Moved everything from timer.c into either edit.c
		or irc.c.  Made WINDOW_CREATE define more parts
		out, in irc.c, mysetjmp.[ch], and window.c.

Tue Jan  5 20:59:36 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/exec.c:
		Reformatted, and new element of the process list
		added, server, to allow /exec -out/msg/notice
		to go to the right server.

	source/newio.c:
		reformatted.

Tue Jan  5 18:06:25 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/edit.c, source/keys.c:
		Added new function parsekeycmd(), and new command,
		PARSEKEY which calls it - does the same as typing
		a key which is bound the the arguement.

Tue Jan  5 17:03:04 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/window.c:
		Changed window() so that the WINDOW CHANNEL
		command with no arguments make the current
		window's channel null.

Tue Jan  5 16:15:51 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/wserv.c:
		Changed got_sigint() to send the ^C down the pipe,
		rather than kill SIGINT the ircII process, as this
		was causing the ^C to be read as though it was from
		the main screen.

Tue Jan  5 01:57:58 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/edit.c:
		Changed new_send_line() to set the display on.

Mon Jan  4 23:46:58 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	source/vars.h.proto, source/vars.c, source/hook.c, source/edit.c,
	config.h:
		New variable INPUT_PROTECTION.  Doesn't allow any
		ON INPUT's to be added when set.  ON INPUT moved to
		send_line(), so that all input is caught in the hook,
		SENDLINE command added, that calls the new function,
		new_send_line, that does a simliar thing to the send_line
		command, except, no handling for prompts, or ON INPUT is
		done during this.

Mon Jan  4 15:23:34 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	hook.c:
		reformatted.

Fri Jan  1 23:46:03 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	*.h:
		Fixed all the header files, so that if included more than
		once, they are only parsed once.
