    ~ merged ircii-20011210 changes (without ISO-2022-JP stuff and mIRC
      color stuff - sorry but my screen.c is too different these days
      from ircII and ircII won't allow for ANSI color codes, also removed
      ircII's SET SHOW_STARS and SET STAR_PREFIX in favour of my, more
      complete code, there is no support for %v (voice status) in status
      bar as ScrollZ already uses %@ for that)
    + ARINWIN BOTH to always display public in window with level USERLOG4
      (even when public's channel is current channel, requested by fox)

      plus I have also described all ScrollZ modifications such as
      additional functions, status variables and all SETs (I really hope
      someone is gonna take over the docs project as I simply don't have
      time to do both the coding and the docs)
      WARNING: SHELP is gone, use HELP from now on!
    + REPWORD is now taken in consideration on actions, we use COLOR ME
      color number 6 for this (requested by skuum)
    + NICKCHAN to display nick change in all user's channels (only once per
      window though, much like SHOWSIGN for signoffs, requested by fox)
    + AWAYENCR to toggle encryption of ScrollZ.away on or off (the file is
      encrypted using master password, a tool to decrypt such encrypted
      files can be found in tools directory)
    + hopefully made scandir() stuff work on all platforms by moving the
      #ifdef magic to scandir.h
    ! ircII NICK bug where entering existing nick twice resulted in client
      believing it gained the nick (reported by dethnite and braneded)

      (reported by Matt Mills)
    ! crash in RECONNECT/SERVER when IRCHOST was set to an invalid IP

      number of ciphers (suggested by Cnf--)
    ! hopefully ANSI characters in input prompt now work fine in all
      terminal emulators

    ! ircII bug with meta keys 6,7 and 8 being sticky (reported by nms)

ScrollZ v1.8m, 15.10.2001

    ~ AUTORECON crash (reported by Tero)
    - debian subdirectory
    ~ default compile time flags in defs.h.in
    + man page (contributed by Debian maintainer Mike Markley)
    ~ distclean now removes auto generated header files
    ~ prefix/lib to prefix/share/scrollz
    ! compile without -DWANTANSI

      requested by entropy)
    + WINDOW SIZE (requested by MadHack)
    ~ changed .ircquick to .scrollzquick
    + permanent ignores (the ones set with IGNORE command) are now saved
      to ScrollZ.save (requested by ogre)
    ! channel settings not being set upon join from .scrollzrc (thanks
      to gamo for figuring this out)
    + define for alphabetically sorted nicks in CSCAN to defs.h
    - AUTORECON since it is handled by a SET
    + anonymous channel topic handling on hybrid7 (reported by braneded)
    + numeric 308 (server admin) on hybrid7 (patch submitted by braneded)
    ! -DCELECOSM without -DCELE compile (reported by braneded)
    ! numeric 477 for IRCNet
    + numeric 276 (virtual channels) on hybrid7 (request by braneded)
    + INSTALL.ScrollZ in doc subdirectory (hello Exodus)
    ! handle ! channels on ircd 2.10 properly, not the ircII way
      (reported by Ahnberg)
    ~ tabkey handler, when line starts with /MSG we adhere to the pre 1.8l
      tabeky behaviour (line is cleared when tab is pressed and next nick
      from the list is inserted, requested by several users)
    + re-added ^T bind so one can use it to insert nicks when line starts
      with /MSG (see above)
    ! status bar bug where string was cut one column too early (reported
      by jaska)
    + CHPASS filter - now removes user's password (suggested by braneded)

    ~ mass commands take -F to mean affect/don't affect friends. we'll still
      accept -O in case scripts use it. MHOP only sends +h for non opped
      users. MASSV only sends +v for non halfopped / opped users. they're
      also more specific when nobody's to be affected. i.e. MOP -O said
      "no users to op on #channel". now says "no friends to op on #channel"
      (coded by braneded)
    + MC sends -a on hybrid7 servers (coded by braneded)
    + halfops stuff in CHANST and improved look (coded by braneded)
    ~ index is now a section in ScrollZ.help (idea by braneded)

    - Cdcc handling via messages
    + timestamp to DCC chat (requested by ogre)
    + TOPICLOCK and TOPICUNLOCK to lock/unlock topic (requested by acidflash)

    ! hash function to work with high ASCII nicks (used on Russian servers,
      reported by Koban)
    - orignick based on notify signoff
    + ORIGNICK now allows multiple nicks (separate them with comma, requested
      by fox)
    ~ annoying PONG notice when connecting through psyBNC (thanks to markalso
      for debugging) but other things might not work 100% because psyBNC mucks
      with the data stream between client and server
    ! don't crash doing MAP if no LINKS info is returned by ircd (reported
      by braneded)
    + customizable timestamp format (SET STAMP_FORMAT to see default example,

    ~ MODELOCK w/o args now shows stored mode locks for all channels
      (requested by ogre)

      one reported this for the past 2 years
    ! status %! and %y ate one character when invalid args were supplied
    ! status bar and input prompt now honour the value of SET DISPLAY_ANSI
      (found out by ogre)
    + people with Cdcc flag in userlist are exempt from queue and minspeed
      checking (requested by Blaxthos)
    ! display all settings properly not just ORIGNICK
    ! close slow DCC if file transfer does not meet minimum speed (stale

    + CTCP yournick CDCC QUEUE will tell user their queue position
      (requested by Blaxthos)
    + LLOOK can now store and load information from a file (requested by
      Ahnberg, see help for more information)
    ~ new and improved tabkey handling, if input line starts with /msg nick
      client cycles through msg list otherwise it cycles through nicks
      matching word to the left of the cursor, this can be used to complete
      one channel too (idea by Ahnberg and fox) - this means tabkey in the
      middle of input line is now possible
    - NICK_COMPLETION is gone because of the above
    ~ ^T is back to TRANSPOSE_CHARACTERS

      Ahnberg and fox)
    + quarantined nicks, full I: line and X: line warning parsing to OV
      (requested by ogre)
    ! crash in input line history search (ircII bug)
    + TIME option to LASTLOG (example: LASTLOG -TIME 19:00-20:00 would only
      print lastlog entries between 19:00 and 20:00), it works only with

      formatted the display (reported by Ahnberg)

      by Myrlin)
    ! whois queue handling with servers that in some cases return only
      numeric 401 but not numeric 318 (thanks to markalso for helping me
      with this one)
    ~ STAMP to show time stamp for a lot more events, read help for more
      information (rule of thumb: time stamp is displayed where SCROLLZ_STRING
      would be displayed in older releases when STAMP is set to MAX)
    + new argument NOMODES in OV to supress sending user modes to server when
      OperVision is enabled/disabled (see help for more information, requested
      by crystlize)
    + SET AUTO_RECONNECT to enable/disable automatic reconnect, SET is used so
      it can be set prior to connect in ~/.scrollzrc (aparently some servers
      K: line you for doing this, requested by Jakes)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.8j, 15.8.2000

Note that the below log is in some cases inconsistent because it was
written accross the v1.8i# (#=1-6) series. Hopefully from now on I'll
be releasing new version in shorter intervals. Also new web page is
in works and will be announced when it will be ready! The changelog
for versions pre 1.8j has been deleted and will be available on the
web page.

    ! Cdcc min speed bug (reported by EA)
    + flags are now used in ScrollZ.save for userlist and shitlist entries
      instead of cryptic numbers
    ! auto nick completion bug
    ! CDCC LOAD now updates number of offered packages
    + added MKILL (in -DACID) by acidflash (DEFKILL is default reason, it is
      saved in ScrollZ.save)
    ! core dump on WHOIS in some cases when country was defined
      (reported by PreZ)
    ! userlist/shitlist bug related to whowas buffer

      (thanks to c9c1 for help and hints)

    + encryption for userlist passwords (if you use this feature ask
      for utility that will update ScrollZ.save, requested by cain)

    + DCC, Cdcc, tabkey and auto-reply are now multiple servers compliant
      (requested by several users)
    + SET DCC_PORTS, usage is /set dcc_ports low_port-high_port, this
      tells client to only use ports from range low-port-high_port for DCC
      connections (this is useful for people who are behind a firewall so
      they can open only a limited number of ports), when set to 0 it has
      no effect (requested by someone whose nick I forgot, if you are
      reading this please remind me to put your name here). Note that this
      is only used for DCC CHAT and DCC SEND.
    + CHSIGNOFF to -DEXTRAS, when set to on it will display list of channels

    + STAMP, when enabled client will show time in front of publics

      by ogre)
    ! JOIN 1,2,3 now joins #1, #2 and #3 (reported by Merlin)
    ! odd bug on join where channel would be suddenly bound to completely

      list and whowas buffer for channels
    ! crash when user sent large ammounts of files (reported by arc)
    ! shitlist bug with ident being 10 characters long
    ! CHSIGNOFF always showing regardless of setting (reported by kali)

      by Zero)

      matches DCC nick (reported by Myrdraal)

      digits 1-6 represent color1 through color6 from COLOR SBAR
      whereas digits 7-9 and letters a-c represent color1 through
      color6 from COLOR SBAR2 - take a look at default status bar
      variables to see use of this then try COLOR SBAR BLACKBG to
      see it at work (idea and coding by Zakath)
    ! crash when there were no servers in server list (there were
      two related bugs, one on my part and the other is from stock
      client - this is system dependant, reported by Myrdraal)
    ! bitch mode bug (reported by ogre)

      (ScrollZ, Pupette, C-ToolZ and BitchX formats are supported, thanks
      to asylum and acidflash for snippets of code)
    ~ tabkey behaviour, if input line is /m nick<space> it cycles
      through tabkey list and if there is no space after nick it cycles

      acidflash and Merlin)
    ! annoying PONG messages from server being displayed when client got
      confused about server name
    ! tabkey bug introduced with change in tabkey behaviour

      *** Wizner (w@blah.somehost.com) has joined channel #reallylongchannel
      <Wizner:#real> hi
      *** Value of TRUNCATE_PUBLIC_CHANNEL set to OFF
      <Wizner:#reallylongchannel> hi
    + QUICKSTAT command, which uses STATUS_FORMAT3. Default bind is F6.
      This should be considered work in progress.

      moved to general client, it is ON for Celerity and OFF otherwise)
