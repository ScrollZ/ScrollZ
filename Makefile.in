#   all, everything	- compiles ircii, ircio, ircflush and wserv
#   ircio		- compiles ircio
#   ircflush		- compiles ircflush
#   wserv		- compiles wserv
#   install		- installs ircii, ircio, ircflush and wserv the scripts
#			  and the translation tables.
#   installirc		- installs ircii
#   installio		- installs ircio
#   installwserv	- installs wserv

#   installhelp		- installs the help files
#   installman          - installs the manual pages.
#   installeverything   - all of the above
#   clean               - remove all .o files, core, and binaries
#   distclean           - remove all files geneated by compilation/installation.

# these are legacy things from ircii 2.2 that haven't yet been

# For Apollo systems (10.2 and upwards) use the following with BSD defaults:
# DEFS = -Asys,bsd4.3

# Use one of the following for mips systems:
# Choice 1, if your system has the wait3() call
# DEFS = -systype bsd43
# Choice 2, if your system has the wait2() call
# DEFS = -systype bsd43 -Duse_wait2
#
# Or, if you only have sysv installed, use one of the following:
# DEFS = -DMIPS_SYSV
# DEFS = -DMIPS_SYSV -Duse_wait2

## You probably don't need to change anything below this line

# Uncomment the following if you want a secure IRC which binds to a
# privileged port. This feature is completely useless in the current
# IRC environment, but in the future some servers may use privileged
# port systems to verify users connecting to them. The value of
# PRIV_PORT determines the minimum port number to use.
# If you modify these (including uncommenting them) you will need to
# touch config.h
#
# If you are on a system where test-suid works, you can simply define
# PP_DEFS to be PRIV_PORT_ULC and irc will change effective UID back
# to a normal user immediately, and change to root when binding a port.
# This feature is undocumented, but is known to work on Sun, MIPS and
# Apollo (Cos we've tested them already).  Note that it's almost 
# _CERTAIN_ that ircII has security problems with buffer overflows
# in it's code that having it setuid root is the wrong thing to do
# and this is _STRONGLY_ advised against.

# its script files if the environment variable is undefined.
# Usually, this should contain the same path as used for INSTALL_SCRIPT in
# the Makefile, but it can contain multiple path elements
# separated by colons. The path MUST lead to an existing directory,
# because the 'global' script is expected to be found there.

# in a window of ircII. The 'shell' script uses it, so also update
